# Python Line and Word Counter

This Python script is designed to count the number of lines and words in a file. The user is prompted to input the path of the file they wish to analyze, and the script will return the line count and word count of the file.

## Libraries Used

- **os**: The os library in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. In this script, it is used to verify if the file path entered by the user is valid.

## Functions

- **count_lines(file_path)**: This function takes a file path as an argument and returns the number of lines in the file. It opens the file in read mode, reads all the lines into a list, and then returns the length of the list.

- **count_words(file_path)**: This function takes a file path as an argument and returns the number of words in the file. It opens the file in read mode, reads the entire file into a string, splits the string into a list of words, and then returns the length of the list.

- **main()**: This is the main function of the script. It prompts the user to enter a file path, checks if the file path is valid, and if it is, it calls the count_lines and count_words functions and prints their results.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in a Python environment. When prompted, enter the path of the file you wish to analyze. The script will then print the line count and word count of the file.

```bash
python line_word_counter.py
```

## Note

This script assumes that the file to be analyzed is a text file and that words are separated by spaces. It may not work correctly with other types of files or with text files that use unusual word separators.

# C# Documentation

# CSharp Word and Line Counter

This is a simple C# script that counts the number of lines and words in a given text file. The script takes a file path as an argument, reads the file, and outputs the total number of lines and words.

## Script Explanation

The script begins by checking if a file path has been provided. If not, it prompts the user to provide one. It then checks if the file at the provided path exists. If the file does not exist, it informs the user and terminates.

The script then reads all the lines in the file into an array and counts the number of lines. It also counts the number of words in each line by splitting the line at each space or tab character and counting the resulting words.

Finally, the script outputs the total number of lines and words.

## Imported Libraries

The script uses the following libraries:

- `System`: This is a fundamental library in C# that provides classes for handling primitive types, dates, and times, among other things. In this script, it is used for basic functionality like writing to the console.

- `System.IO`: This library provides classes for reading and writing files and data streams, and for basic file and directory support. In this script, it is used to check if the file exists and to read the lines of the file.

- `System.Linq`: This library provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language-Integrated Query (LINQ). In this script, it is not directly used, but it is generally useful for working with data in a more declarative way.

# Java Documentation

# FileLineCounter

This Java script, `FileLineCounter`, reads a text file and provides two pieces of information: the total number of lines in the file and the frequency of each word in the file.

## How it works

The script takes a file path as an argument. It reads the file line by line, incrementing a counter for each line read. For each line, it splits the line into words and increments a counter for each word. At the end, it prints out the total number of lines and the frequency of each word.

## Imported Libraries

The script uses the following libraries:

- `java.io.BufferedReader`: This class reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. In this script, it is used to read the file line by line.

- `java.io.FileReader`: This class is a convenience class for reading character files. The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are appropriate. In this script, it is used to open the file for reading.

- `java.io.IOException`: This class signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred. This class is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations. In this script, it is used to handle any errors that occur while reading the file.

- `java.util.HashMap`: This class implements the `Map` interface, which maps keys to values. It allows null values and the null key. This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. In this script, it is used to store the frequency of each word.

- `java.util.Map`: This interface represents a mapping between a set of keys and a set of values. Each key is mapped to a single value. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. In this script, it is used to store the frequency of each word.

## Usage

To use this script, compile it and run it with the file path as an argument. For example:

```
javac FileLineCounter.java
java FileLineCounter /path/to/file.txt
```

The script will print out the total number of lines and the frequency of each word.
